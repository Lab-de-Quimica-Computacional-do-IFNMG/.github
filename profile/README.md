# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to Our Organization!  

We are an organization dedicated to developing tools and content for **Chemistry education** with the support of **Computer Science**. Our goal is to integrate **Cheminformatics** concepts into Chemistry classes, using computational libraries to simplify and innovate learning.

## ðŸ’¡ What Do We Do?  
We work with cutting-edge technologies to build solutions that connect Chemistry with Computer Science. Some of the main libraries we use are:  
- **RDKit**: For molecular structure manipulation and chemical property calculations.  
- **PyMOL**: For 3D molecular visualization.  
- **Pandas**: For chemical data analysis and manipulation.  
- **Matplotlib**: For creating graphs and visualizations.  

Our focus is to bring complex concepts into the classroom in a practical and accessible way, enabling teachers and students to explore the potential of Computational Chemistry.

## ðŸŒŸ How Can You Get Involved?  
1. Contribute to our open-source projects.  
2. Join discussions and share ideas to improve Chemistry education.  
3. Use our tools and provide feedback so we can continue evolving.  

## ðŸ“š Useful Resources  
- Documentation for our tools and projects.  
- Examples of library usage for educational purposes.  
- Tutorials and guides for teachers interested in integrating Computer Science into Chemistry classes.
